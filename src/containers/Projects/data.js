export const DenvolDescr = (<p>
    My latest freelance project for construction company.
    Web application is fully responsive and is built with <strong>React.</strong> <br/>
    Used Firebase as a media storage and database. Styling of the page is written with pure SASS.
</p>);
export const FirstProjDescr = (<p>
    My first ever project that I have developed with <br/>
    HTML, LESS, JavaScript, Jquery and Gulp.
</p>);
export const Redesign = (<p>
    My school re-design project of existing website. I chose the "beerstore",
    because at the time they had really poorly designed and written web application.
    I wrote purely on HTML5, CSS and Vanilla JS since we couldn't use anything else.
</p>);
export const Lamp = (<p>
    One of my most complicated projects in terms of logic and coding.
    The way it works is user has to import certain csv file with Microwave radio systems data.
    Application is scanning the file, validating and parsing its content and adds it to the database.
    Once this process has finished, user can see the tabled output on the web page, as well as changing
    it in real time with updates in database. After all the calculations visual graphic is being displayed.
